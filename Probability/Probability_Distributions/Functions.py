# size is a number that represents how many values to choose
# replace can be equal to True or False, and determines whether we keep a value in a after drawing it
# (replace = True) or remove it from the pool (replace = False).

# A probability mass function (PMF) is a type of probability distribution that defines the probability of

# binomial distribution at any value. This method takes 3 values:
# x: the value of interest
# n: the number of trials
# p: the probability of success

# Letâ€™s say we want to know the probability that a randomly chosen woman is less than 158 cm tall.

# and the total area under this curve adds up to 1.
# We can calculate the area of the shaded region in Python using the norm.cdf() function.
